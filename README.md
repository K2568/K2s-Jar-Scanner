# K2s-Jar-Scanner
Gives you a list of embedded mods within mods and also scans for MCreator
This is completely safe to use, it only ever calls read functions and never write. You can read through the file if you want to.

## Instructions:
Don't run this in your downloads folder or it will scan every jar you have in there and could lag.
Make a folder somewhere and put this file and any jar files of mods you want to use in the same folder as it.
Run the python program and it will give you an output.
